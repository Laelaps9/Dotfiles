# My Linux Dotfiles
These are the dotfiles I use for my Linux computer. I will try to specify the dependencies needed for each file and add examples so that you can see before you decide if you want to use them.  
Keep in mind that these files may change somewhat frequently. I'm trying to personalize Linux to fit my needs, you might have different preferences so be sure to read the descriptions and back up your current config files before using them.
